# Sunsynk Power Flow Card

An animated Home Assistant card to emulate the power flow that's shown on the Sunsynk Inverter screen. You can use this to display data from many inverters e.g. Sunsynk, Deye, Solis, Lux, FoxESS, Goodwe, Huawei etc as long as you have the required sensor data. See the [wiki](https://github.com/slipx06/sunsynk-power-flow-card/wiki) for integration methods and examples.

2. Copy the `sunsynk-power-flow-card.js` into the directory.
